## Hi there 👋
👋 Hi! I’m Akhila, a developer who loves coding and pizza. 🍕💻  
💡 I have experience building apps with Kotlin and Android Studio,
but I’m also passionate about exploring the web development world — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my current playgrounds.  
🌱 I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with projects, and sharing what I learn with the community.
 I’m always open to collaboration and building cool things with fellow developers!
